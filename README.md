<div align="center">
 <h1 align="center">Visitor-Counter-System
</h1>
  <h3 align="center"> During Covid-19 we need to monitor the person/people visiting someplace like shopping mall, conference room or office. This project can be used to count and display the number of visitors entering inside the room. This is a unidirectional counter which means it works in a single way. That means a counter will be incremented if a person enters the room. LCD displays this value which is placed outside the room. </h3>
